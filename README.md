# Menari: A Comprehensive LLM Development Project

`Menari` is an ambitious, multi-phased project dedicated to the in-depth exploration and development of Large Language Models (LLMs). This initiative aims to build a foundational understanding of LLM architecture by implementing core components from scratch, constructing a small functional language model, and eventually fine-tuning existing state-of-the-art models.

## Vision

To demystify the complexities of LLMs by providing a hands-on, modular approach to their development, fostering a deep understanding of their internal workings and practical applications.

## Project Phases

1.  **Menari-core (LLM Component Implementation):** Focuses on building fundamental LLM components (tokenization, embeddings, attention mechanisms).
2.  **Small, Functional Language Model:** Assembles the components into a complete, albeit small, text generation model.
3.  **Fine-tuning Existing Models:** Explores practical applications by fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs for specific tasks.

## Getting Started

More detailed instructions for each phase will be available in their respective sub-projects.

## Roadmap

Refer to `menari_llm_todo.txt` for a detailed roadmap of the project's development phases and objectives.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This project is a learning journey, and any insights or improvements are highly valued.
